# Financial Planner
The purpose of the financial planner is to build two financial planning applications: (1) one for personal savings (2) one for retirement portfolio.

Use APIs and software development kits (SDKs) to access financial data.

Apply statistical concepts, like probability distributions and confidence intervals, to measure the likelihood of future outcomes.

Create a Monte Carlo simulation that forecasts the long-term future performance of a retirement portfolio.
